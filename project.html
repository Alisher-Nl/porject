<p>
    <strong>Uzbek Cuisine</strong> is full of flavor and rich in its Calories
    which would make the perfect family meal for dinner and takeout. New York 
    has a diverse variety of different restaurants. They specialize in traditional
    foods which would be greasy and heavy with meat.

<p>
    This is not typical fast food this type of food would 
    be heavy and when your hungry. They are all not heavy 
    and greasy because it takes effort to make the traditional
    food you would need at least 2 and half hours.
